    1. In a cooking pan, at medium heat, cook the butter until it's mostly melted.
    2. Add the flour and mix thoroughly until there are no lumps.
    3. Add the milk and mix thoroughly until everything is dissolved.
    4. Add the grated Parmesan cheese. If you don't have Parmesan, any other aged cheese should do.

    6. Lower the heat and keep continuously mixing, preferably with a whisk, until the sauce thickens.

This is [Gennaro Contaldo's](https://www.youtube.com/user/gennarocontaldo) recipe for Béchamel or white sauce. I mostly make it whenever I'm cooking lasagne. The recipe serves roughly 4 people, but I usually make around 750 ml of milk and use a bigger baking dish.
